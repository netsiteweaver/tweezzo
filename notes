✅ 1. Define Scope Clearly (if not done already)

If the task doesn't have a scope/acceptance criteria, the client will keep adding things because there's no clear finish line.

    Next time: For each task or deliverable, write 2–3 bullet points:

        What’s expected

        What’s not included

        When it’s considered “done”

Tip: You can add a little line at the bottom of tasks:

    "Any changes beyond this scope will be treated as a new task and scheduled accordingly."

✅ 2. Use a Soft But Firm Response Template

When they return something trivial or out of scope, respond like this:

    “Thanks for the feedback! That change wasn’t included in the initial task scope, so I’d be happy to treat it as a new request. Would you like me to estimate time/cost or just queue it up as a new task?”

It shows:

    You’re open to helping

    But you’re not accepting endless tweaks for free

✅ 3. Log Changes Publicly

Track their returns and comments in a task system (e.g., Trello, Notion, ClickUp, etc.). This builds transparency and discourages excessive returns when they can see a history of 8+ back-and-forths.
✅ 4. Implement a Limit on Revisions

Say you offer 2 rounds of revision per task. Anything beyond that:

    Becomes a billable update

    Goes to the end of the task queue

    “Just a heads up: we’re past the 2 included revisions for this task, so this next one will be handled as a separate mini task.”
